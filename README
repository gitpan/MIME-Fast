MIME::Fast - Parsing MIME messages (wrapper for C gmime library)

MIME::Fast is a perl module for creating, editing and parsing MIME messages.
This module is based on the very good C library called
gmime (currently in development). MIME::Fast outght to be faster and should
use less memory and CPU resources than standard MIME (perl module),
because MIME::Fast is the wrapper for C functions (calling C function
is much, much less expensive than calling perl function).

You should have gmime library installed.

WARNING: this code is still in beta phase, and interface methods
could change.

Install package with:

perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install

Bugs and questions should be mailed to the author.
